# Possible solutions

* gridsome, provides everything, is perfect, but is not maintained and npm cries for security problems
* hugo, extremely fast
* nuxtjs, the result is too big 10Mb for a simple page that does nothing, also endo of live
* nuxtjs3, the result does nto have the html content
* sveltekit, the result does not have the transaltions
* vuejs, cannot work due to no content in resulting html
* gatsby, it is react, bad internationalization didnt go far
